                <h2>HTML</h2>
                <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is the combination
                        of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages. A markup language is used to define the text
                        document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer)
                        text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable.
                        The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text. </p>

                       <p> Features of HTML:</p> 
                    <ul>
                       <li> It is easy to learn and easy to use.</li>
                       <li>It is platform-independent.</li>
                       <li>Images, videos, and audio can be added to a web page.</li>
                       <li>Hypertext can be added to the text.</li>
                       <li>t is a markup language.</li>

            <h2>CSS</h2>
           <p> Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
             CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page. It
              describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colors, fonts, spacing, and much more. In short, you can make your website look however you want.
               CSS lets developers and designers define how it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser.
            While html uses tags, css uses rulesets. CSS is easy to learn and understand, but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.</p>

            <p> Features of CSS:</p>
              <ul>  
                <li>CSS saves time: You can write CSS once and reuse the same sheet in multiple HTML pages.</li>
                <li>Easy Maintenance: To make a global change simply change the style, and all elements in all the webpages will be updated automatically.</li>
                <li>Search Engines: CSS is considered a clean coding technique, which means search engines won’t have to struggle to “read” its content.</li>
                <li>Superior styles to HTML: CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.</li>
                <li>Offline Browsing: CSS can store web applications locally with the help of an offline cache. Using this we can view offline websites.</li>
            </ul>

                <P>JavaScript (JS) is the most popular lightweight, interpreted compiled programming language. It can be used for both Client-side as well as Server-side developments. 
                    JavaScript also known as a scripting language for web pages.
                    JavaScript is used by many developers (65% of the total development community), and the number is increasing day by day. JavaScript is one such programming language 
                    that has more than 1444231 libraries and increasing rapidly. It is preferred over any other programming language by most developers. Also, major tech companies like Microsoft,
                     Uber, Google, Netflix, and Meta use JavaScript in their projects.</P>

                    it is free to download and use. It is very simple to learn and use. The files have the extension “.php”. 
                    Rasmus Lerdorf inspired the first version of PHP and participated in the later versions. It is an interpreted language and it does not require a compiler. </p>
